Lite Version of my Geo Blocker. Support: http://steamcommunity.com/id/M0m0x/ (**LEAVE A COMMENT BEFORE ADDING ME**)

But why is it free now?

Normally it could be on GmodStore now well but there were a few "smaller problems". Also I was forced to add a lot of useless shit (like 2/3 of the whole code) to make it worthy to be sold. This version comes without that shit. 

Also: Here's the whole (sad) story on GmodStore, I don't want to start a witch hunt but in my opinion the Moderation team was not careful enough while testing (but still: It was me doing errors in the script). In case you want to read it, here's 1 of 50 dev comments: http://puu.sh/wmKxi/9464908c61.png
